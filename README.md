# cyber-security

As a professional interested in cybersecurity, my strengths lie in my analytical mindset and continuous pursuit of knowledge, applying it to problem solving. I have a strong foundation in programming languages and information systems, and I am committed to developing further expertise in the various fields of cyber security. My goal is to be aware of the vulnerabilities and create security measures to mitigate risks in any kind of information system, or at least have the understanding of which steps should I follow to achieve this purpose.

The cornerstone of my ethics is the public discussion of what we, as a group (association, organization, society), consider to be the right way to do whatever (allowing everyone to speak up), and once this is achieved, take the measurements to avoid any disruptance in the implementation of what we have agreed on.
